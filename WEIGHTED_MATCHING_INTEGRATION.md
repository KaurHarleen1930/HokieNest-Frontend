# Weighted Matching Integration Guide

This guide shows how to integrate the weighted question system directly into the existing "Find Roommates" tab.

## What's New

The enhanced roommate matching system adds **weight assignments** for important questionnaire questions directly in the "Find Roommates" tab. Users can now:

1. **Adjust question weights** using sliders (1-5 scale)
2. **See real-time ranking updates** based on their weight preferences
3. **View detailed score breakdowns** showing how each factor contributes to the match
4. **Get personalized rankings** based on their specific priorities

## Integration Steps

### Option 1: Replace Existing Component (Recommended)

1. **Backup the current file:**
   ```bash
   cp src/pages/RoommateMatching.tsx src/pages/RoommateMatching.tsx.backup
   ```

2. **Replace with enhanced version:**
   ```bash
   cp src/pages/EnhancedRoommateMatching.tsx src/pages/RoommateMatching.tsx
   ```

3. **Update imports in App.tsx** (if needed):
   ```tsx
   // The import should remain the same
   import RoommateMatching from "./pages/RoommateMatching";
   ```

### Option 2: Add as New Route

1. **Add to App.tsx routes:**
   ```tsx
   import EnhancedRoommateMatching from "./pages/EnhancedRoommateMatching";
   
   // Add this route
   <Route path="/enhanced-roommate-matching" element={
     <ProtectedRoute>
       <EnhancedRoommateMatching />
     </ProtectedRoute>
   } />
   ```

2. **Add navigation link** (optional):
   ```tsx
   <Link to="/enhanced-roommate-matching" className="text-foreground hover:text-accent transition-colors font-medium">
     Enhanced Matching
   </Link>
   ```
