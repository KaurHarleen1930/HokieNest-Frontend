# Email Verification Setup Complete! 🎉

I've implemented a complete email verification system for your VT student authentication. Here's what was added:

## ✅ What's Implemented

### Backend Changes:
1. **Database Schema** - Added email verification fields to User model:
   - `emailVerified` (Boolean)
   - `verificationToken` (String, unique)
   - `verificationExpiry` (DateTime)

2. **Email Service** - Created `server/src/utils/email.ts`:
   - Sends beautiful branded verification emails
   - Uses VT colors (#861F41)
   - 24-hour token expiry

3. **Auth Routes** - Updated `server/src/routes/auth.ts`:
   - Signup now generates verification tokens
   - Login checks email verification status
   - New `/verify-email` endpoint
   - New `/resend-verification` endpoint

### Frontend Changes:
1. **New Verification Page** - `/verify-email`:
   - Automatically verifies email from link
   - Shows success/error status
   - Redirects to login after success

2. **Updated Signup Page**:
   - Shows toast notification after signup
   - Redirects to login page
   - Instructs users to check email

3. **Enhanced Login Page**:
   - Shows clear error if email not verified
   - "Resend Verification Email" button
   - Better error handling

## 🚀 Next Steps (Required)

### 1. Install Resend Package
```bash
cd server
npm install resend
```

### 2. Run Database Migration
```bash
cd server
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_email_verification
npx prisma generate
```

### 3. Restart Your Backend Server
```bash
cd server
npm run dev
```

## 📧 How It Works

1. **User signs up** with @vt.edu email
2. **System sends verification email** to their VT inbox
3. **User clicks link** in email
4. **Email verified** ✅
5. **User can now log in**

## 🧪 Testing

To test email verification:
1. Sign up with a new @vt.edu email
2. Check your VT email inbox for verification link
3. Click the link to verify
4. Return to login page and sign in

**Note:** The system uses `onboarding@resend.dev` as the sender (Resend's test domain). For production, you should verify your own domain at https://resend.com/domains

## 📝 Additional Notes

- Verification tokens expire after 24 hours
- Users can request a new verification email from the login page
- Already verified users won't be affected
- Existing demo accounts in the database will need their `emailVerified` field set to `true` manually or via seed script

Enjoy your secure VT email verification system! 🎓
