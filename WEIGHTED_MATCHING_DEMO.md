## üìä **How Scores Are Calculated**

### **Individual Compatibility Scores**
Each roommate gets scored on 8 factors (0-100 scale):

1. **Budget Compatibility**: How much budget ranges overlap
2. **Sleep Schedule**: Exact match = 100, Flexible = 70, Different = 30
3. **Cleanliness**: Based on level difference (20 points per level)
4. **Social Vibe**: Exact match = 100, Similar = 70, Different = 40
5. **Pet Compatibility**: Mock score (70-100)
6. **Work From Home**: Mock score (70-100)
7. **Guest Frequency**: Mock score (70-100)
8. **Smoking Policy**: Mock score (70-100)

### **Weighted Score Calculation**
```
Weighted Score = (Compatibility Score √ó Weight) √∑ 5

Example:
- Sleep Schedule: 100 compatibility √ó 5 weight = 500 √∑ 5 = 100 points
- Budget: 80 compatibility √ó 2 weight = 160 √∑ 5 = 32 points
- Total: 100 + 32 + other factors = Final Score
```

### **Final Ranking**
- **Total weighted score** calculated for each roommate
- **Roommates sorted** by weighted score (highest first)
- **Score breakdowns** show individual factor contributions
